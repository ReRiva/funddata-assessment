# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

### Introduction
A repository that contains the weekly assessments and exercises for the Fundamental of Data Analysis as well as a Project on the Normal Distribution

### Description
Weekly Assessments-Exercises:
- 01-information-exercises.ipynb - Exercises from the Information Notebook
- 02-radomess-exercises.ipynb - Exercises from the Randomness Notebook
- 03-bias-exercises.ipynb  - Exercises from the Bias Notebook
- 04-outliers-exercises.ipynb - Exercises from the Outliers Notebook
- 05-cleasing-exercises.ipynb - Exercises from the Cleansing Notebook

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To run this project locally you are going to need Python(and its packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy and MatplotLib) and Jupyter Notebook as well. You can gey both of Python and Jupyter by downloading [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
You may need to install/update some of the Python's packages.

You can use the code below to install/update your packages:
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install seaborn
```
```
pip install scipy
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
